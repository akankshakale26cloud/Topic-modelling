# Topic Modeling and Text Classification

This project uses **topic modeling** to identify hidden genres in text data and improve recommendation systems.  
It classifies articles into genres such as **World**, **Sports**, **Business**, and **Sci/Tech** by leveraging text embeddings and scalable classification methods.

## Project Overview

- Developed a topic modeling and text classification system on the **AG News** dataset *(Sep 2024 â€“ Dec 2024)*  
- Utilized **DistilBERT** embeddings with GPU acceleration for efficient feature extraction  
- Applied **PCA** for dimensionality reduction to optimize model performance  
- Achieved classification accuracies of:  
  - **91.21%** with Logistic Regression  
  - **86.35%** with Nearest Neighbor  
- Visualized clusters using **t-SNE** to interpret model behavior and genre groupings  
- Created a scalable NLP pipeline suitable for article genre recommendation tasks
